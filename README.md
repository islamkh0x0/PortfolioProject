# PortfolioProject
This is my personal portfolio website, designed while practicing HTML and CSS. It includes a simple roadmap for beginners in cybersecurity, covering essential topics such as programming basics, networking, Linux, and key security concepts. I have also included learning resources, all in Arabic, to help others get started in the field.
